## CASE4: Facial price VS store's gross margin
`Background`: A marketing team works in a chain of spas and they look for ways to increase the gross margin. I decided to experiment with the price of facial. Currently, the stores offer facials for $98.99. We need run a A/B test with different prices of facials, assuming that the average customer visits a store about once every ten weeks. 

`Goal`:I'd like to predict whether a change in price would yield greater gross margin if the facials were $87.99 or $76.99.  

### Set up a `Randomized Design`:
`Units`: Stores

#### `Treatment Groups`
two treatment groups
1. stores offering facials for $87.99. 
2. stores offering facials for $76.99.

#### `Control Units`
other stores with $98.99.

#### `Prepare the test`

This is the data I have.

`continuous control variables`
1. Average sales per store per month
2. Average number of invoices per month per store 
3. SKU Category

`data I need`
1. 1 year plus minimum of 6 periods (if measure weekly, then may need 12 periods). To use the A/B Trend tool in Alteryx, we need to have a minimum of one year plus 12 periods (weeks) of historical data, so weâ€™ll need a total of 64 weeks of data.
2. length of the experiment (For this case, since the average customer visits a store about once every ten weeks, so the experiment at least last 10 week.)

#### `Run the test`

#### `Analyze the result`
