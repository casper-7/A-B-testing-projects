`Background`: A marketing team works in a chain of spas and they look for ways to increase the gross margin. I decided to experiment with the price of facial. Currently, the stores offer facials for $98.99.We need run a A/B test with different prices of facials, assuming that the average customer visits a store about once every ten weeks. 

`Goal`:I'd like to predict whether a change in price would yield greater gross margin if the facials were $87.99 or $76.99.
