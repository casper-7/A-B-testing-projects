## CASE1: Change the button of the page link to a picture
`Background`: A large grocery chain company's goal is to drive more customers to download their APP and registered the loyalty program. One way of driving customers to download the APP, is via a link on the company website. Page viewing statistics shows that only 10% people who visit the main page, are clicking through to visit the page that describes the app and loyalty program

`Question`: whether changing the button of the page link to a picture would improve the click through rates of visitors who visit the page that describe the app and loyalty program.

### Set up a `Randomized Design`:

`Target variable`——whether or not an individual clicked on the link to visit the APP and loyalty information page.

`Control variable`:
* Type of people (whether or not they would click the link)
  * socioeconomic standing, demographic profile,etc
* Site visit (Ensure we only count each people once regardless how many they click)
  * How frequency they visit the site
* Membership
  * If they already have a card or not

`Sample size`:
* Unit of Diversion = IP addrss
* Population = visitors without an account
* Duration = 1week
* Size = 1/3 treatment and 2/3 control
